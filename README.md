## Development

We whitelist dependency lifecycle scripts (eg. "postinstall") via [@lavamoat/allow-scripts](https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/tree/main/packages/allow-scripts) so you should install dependencies running `yarn setup` instead of just `yarn`.

## Acknowledgements

The extension based on [Polkadot{.js} extension](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension). Thanks to the contributers.
